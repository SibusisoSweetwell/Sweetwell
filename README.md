# Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers

```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3*4)+5
print(result)

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)
